## About ChatTool

ChatTool is a android application with chatting, login, registering, adding friending, listing friends. We want to simplify chattool to suit with some people who don't like complex functions. ChatTool attempts to reduce time that takes on browsing ohters' life and people can get more time to do other things.

## Reference service
We would like to extend our thanks to the [JIGUANG service](https://www.jiguang.cn/) for helping us develop ChatTool. We have used their [JIGUANG IM](https://www.jiguang.cn/im) service to build chatting module. JIGUANG service is a good service for pushing messaging, IM, SMS, and analytics. Building a app with this service is a happy thing.
